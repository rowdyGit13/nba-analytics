# NBA Analytics Dashboard - Streamlit Cloud Deployment

This guide provides instructions for deploying the NBA Analytics Dashboard to Streamlit Cloud.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- Streamlit Cloud account (sign up at https://share.streamlit.io)
- Supabase account and project (or exported CSV data)

### Option 1: Deploy with Supabase Database Connection

1. **Update .env file with your Supabase credentials**:
   ```
   DB_NAME=postgres
   DB_USER=postgres
   DB_PASSWORD=your_supabase_db_password
   DB_HOST=db.yourdatabaseid.supabase.co
   DB_PORT=5432
   SUPABASE_URL=https://yourdatabaseid.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_api_key
   ```

2. **Activate venv and migrate your data to Supabase**:
   ```bash
   # Activate virtual environment
   source venv/bin/activate
   
   # Run the setup script
   python3 manage.py makemigrations nba_data
   python3 manage.py migrate
   ```

3. **Push your code to GitHub**:
   - Create a new repository on GitHub
   - Push your code to the repository

4. **Deploy to Streamlit Cloud**:
   - Sign in to Streamlit Cloud
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Set up the following:
     - Main file path: `streamlit_app/app.py`
     - Python version: 3.11
     - Environment variables (add your Supabase credentials from .env)

### Option 2: Deploy with CSV Data (Simpler)

1. **Export your data to CSV files**:
   ```bash
   # Activate virtual environment
   source venv/bin/activate
   
   # Export data to CSV
   python streamlit_app/export_data.py
   ```

2. **Push your code to GitHub**:
   - Make sure to include the `streamlit_app/data` directory with the CSV files
   - Create a new repository on GitHub
   - Push your code to the repository

3. **Deploy to Streamlit Cloud**:
   - Sign in to Streamlit Cloud
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Set the main file path to `streamlit_app/app.py`
   - No additional environment variables needed

## Advanced Deployment Options

### Secrets Management
For better security, use Streamlit's secrets management:

1. Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file:
   ```toml
   [postgres]
   host = "db.yourdatabaseid.supabase.co"
   port = 5432
   dbname = "postgres"
   user = "postgres"
   password = "your_supabase_password"
   ```

2. Update the app to use these secrets:
   ```python
   import streamlit as st
   # Use st.secrets["postgres"]["password"] instead of os.environ
   ```

### Custom Domain
Streamlit Cloud allows you to set up a custom domain for your app in their paid plans.

## Troubleshooting

- If your app fails to connect to Supabase, check your network settings in Supabase to ensure it allows connections from Streamlit Cloud.
- If you encounter "Missing data" errors, ensure you've run the export_data.py script and included the data directory in your repository.
- For additional help, refer to the Streamlit documentation: https://docs.streamlit.io/streamlit-cloud

# NBA Analytics Dashboard - Streamlit App

This Streamlit application provides an interactive interface for the NBA Analytics Dashboard. It allows users to:

1. **Search for Players and Teams**: Find detailed information about NBA players and teams, including their statistics and performance metrics.

2. **Data Visualization**: Explore team performance data through interactive visualizations:
   - Points per game vs season
   - Points allowed per game vs season
   - Wins vs season
   - Home wins vs season
   - Away wins vs season

## Data Loading Process

The application uses a two-step approach for data loading:

1. **Primary Method**: Direct loading from Django models/database
   - The `data_loader` module directly accesses Django models to fetch and process data
   - This approach provides the most up-to-date information

2. **Fallback Method**: CSV files
   - If direct loading fails, the application falls back to pre-processed CSV files
   - CSV files are automatically generated when running `run.py`

## How to Run

1. Make sure your virtual environment is activated:
   ```
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```
   cd streamlit_app
   python3 run.py
   ```

This will:
1. Set up the Django environment
2. Generate backup CSV files
3. Start the Streamlit server

## File Structure

- `run.py`: Main entry point for the application
- `app.py`: The Streamlit dashboard interface
- `data_loader/`: Module for loading data from Django models or CSV files
  - `load_data.py`: Contains functions to load data from both sources
- `data/processed/`: Directory containing backup CSV files

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with direct data loading:
1. Check your Django database connection
2. Ensure the required models (Teams, Players, Games) have data
3. Run the process_data command manually to generate CSV files:
   ```
   python3 manage.py process_data --export --export-dir streamlit_app/data/processed
   ```

## Features

- **Home Page**: Welcome page with an overview of the dashboard's features.
- **Search Page**: Search for players and teams with detailed statistics.
- **Data Visualization Page**: Interactive visualizations of team performance metrics across seasons.

## Data Sources

The app uses Django models to fetch data from the PostgreSQL database, which is then transformed into pandas DataFrames for analysis and visualization.

    "Player": ["Player A", "Player B"],
    "PPG": [25.3, 20.6],
    "FG_PCT": [0.48, 0.52]
})

# Apply team styling
styled_df = style_dataframe(df, "Lakers")

# Display in Streamlit
st.dataframe(styled_df)
```

### Creating Team-Colored Charts

```python
import pandas as pd
from streamlit_app.chart_utils import create_team_bar_chart, create_team_line_chart

# Create your DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    "Season": ["2021-22", "2022-23"],
    "PPG": [110.5, 115.2]
})

# Create bar chart
bar_chart = create_team_bar_chart(
    df=df,
    x_col="Season",
    y_col="PPG",
    team_name="Celtics",
    title="Celtics Points Per Game"

# Display in Streamlit
st.altair_chart(bar_chart, use_container_width=True)
```

### Shot Charts

```python
import pandas as pd
from streamlit_app.chart_utils import create_shot_chart

# Load your shot data with LOC_X, LOC_Y, SHOT_MADE_FLAG columns
shots_df = pd.DataFrame({
    "LOC_X": [-100, 150, 220],
    "LOC_Y": [50, 200, 150],
    "SHOT_MADE_FLAG": [1, 0, 1]

    player1_name="LeBron James",
    player2_name="Nikola JokiÄ‡"
)

# Display in Streamlit
st.pyplot(radar_chart)
```

### Bubble Charts

```python
import pandas as pd
from streamlit_app.chart_utils import create_bubble_chart

# Create a DataFrame with team data
teams_df = pd.DataFrame({
    "Team": ["Lakers", "Celtics", "Warriors"],
    "PPG": [115.2, 118.3, 120.1],
    "OPP_PPG": [110.5, 108.7, 114.3],
    "WIN_PCT": [0.65, 0.70, 0.62]
