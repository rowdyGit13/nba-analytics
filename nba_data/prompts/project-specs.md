# NBA Analytics Dashboard Project Plan

## Project Overview: NBA Analytics Dashboard

Create a web application that scrapes NBA data, performs statistical analysis, and presents insights through an interactive dashboard. Demonstrate full-stack capabilities while highlighting data science skills for a software engineer portfolio.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Data Collection

1. **Project Initialization**
   - Set up a Django project with PostgreSQL backend
   - Configure virtual environment and dependencies
   - Create initial GitHub repository

2. **Data Collection System**
   - Research NBA API enpoints via balldontlie api
   - Create data scraping scripts using Python requests
   - Build models to store player, team, and game data

## Phase 2: Data Processing & Analysis

1. **Data Pipeline**
   - Clean and transform raw NBA data
   - Use Pandas for data manipulation and preparation
   - Implement NumPy for advanced statistical computations

2. **Analytics Module**
   - Develop algorithms for key basketball metrics
   - Implement trend detection and performance predictions

## Phase 3: Visualization & Frontend

   - Create Django views and templates for the frontend
   - Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS
   - Build interactive components with typscript
   - Use Matplotlib for generating charts
   
Create three webpages:
1. **Landing Page**
   - style: simple and sophisticated
   - function: welcome user, give short description, provide links to next two pages

2. **Player / Team / Data Search Page**
   - enable user to search for a specific team, game, or player. Must specify a season.
   - when user selects search item, render a card that has relevant info:
      Player:
      - player photo
      - height
      - position
      - team name
      - team logo
      Team:
      - team logo
      - points per game
      - points allowed per game
      - record (in format: wins-losses)
   - user should be able to render up to 5 cards at once

2. **Data Visualization Page**
   - users will be able to select a team and then plot the following datasets in a bar chart (based off their selection on a dropdown menu)
      - points per game vs season
      - points allowed per game vs season
      - wins vs season
      - home wins vs season
      - away wins vs season


## Phase 4: Deployment & Documentation

1. **Deployment**
   - Deploy using Vercel
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Ensure database migrations work properly in production
